Description: Android SDK Documentation from Google
 This package will download the Android SDK Documentation from Google and
 create a Debian package.  This package also aims to strip out all calls to
 the networking, including tracking services like Google Analytics and
 Doubleclick. These documentation files still require the Google "jsapi",
 which is only available by fetching it each time from
 http://www.google.com/jsapi.  This package forces it to use https://, but
 otherwise, these docs have to phone home in order for any of the javascript
 to work.
 .
 WARNING: Installing this Debian package causes docs-*.zip to be downloaded
 from https://dl.google.com and/or from other suggested mirrors. 
 Also, since Google is often blocked in China, the install process will try
 again on Chinese mirrors if the Google central download repo is not 
 available.  Since the zipball is checked against the embedded SHA1 checksum,
 the install will fail if the mirror contains a corrupted version.
 .

 The code in the documentation is licensed under the Apache 2.0, and
 the content is licensed under Creative Commons CC-BY 2.5.  The CC-BY
 2.5 license is non-free but can be legally distributed by Debian.
 This package avoids the issue all together since each user directly

 . 
 The Android Support Library offers a number of features that are not built into
 the framework. These libraries offer backward-compatible versions of new 
 features, provide useful UI elements that are not included in the framework,
 and provide a range of utilities that apps can draw on.
